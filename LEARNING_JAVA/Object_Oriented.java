//constructor have same name  as class they have no return type for 1 obj only once a constructor is called
// constructor are of 3 type default,parameter,copy
//in c++ copy const can be made by user or by default but in java copy constr are user defined where ek obk ko copy krk dusre mai daal skate hai
//in c++ we have destructors but in java we have an automatic mechanism ie automatic garbage collector -var not in use gets deletd

//Dynamic method dispatch-Dynamic Method Dispatch is a concept in Java that allows a method to be called based on the actual object that a superclass reference variable is pointing to at runtime. 
//In simple words, itâ€™s a way to decide which method to execute when there are multiple implementations of a method, and it happens during runtime.
//When you have a parent class (say, Animal) and a child class (say, Dog or Cat), you might want to call the sound() method, but each subclass (Dog and Cat) has its own version of sound().
// Using dynamic method dispatch, Java will decide at runtime whether to call sound() of Dog or Cat, depending on the object type.
//i have super class with  method 1 and method2 and subclass with method 2 (overridden) and method 3 
//if i do super obj=new sub()-its allowed obj.meth2()=is called of subclass but if we call obj.meth3()its not allowed

//Method Overloading: Occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters  It's a way to achieve compile-time polymorphism.
//Method Overriding: Occurs when a subclass  has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in the superclass and achieves runtime polymorphism.
