//Polymorphism is of 2 types function overloading(compile time) and function overriding (run time )
//In function overloading we create different function of same name but doing different task
//function overloading can have either different number of arguments or different data type args and complier will automatically uderstand and print the following fucntion related to input  else it will give error
//Method overloading in Java means defining multiple methods within the same class with the same name but different parameter lists

//Inheritance-from 1 class we have to inherit properties to another class we use extends as a keyword
//resusability increases
//its of 4 types  in java single level ,multilevel,hierarchial and hybrid
//in c++ 5th type is multiple inheritance in java we have interfaces instead of it

//single level inheritance -there is 1 base class and 1 deriving class

//ENCAPSULATION
//data and function are combined in a single entity
//becoz of which data hiding concept comes up  using acess modifiers
//data hiding is a prs of protecting members of a class from unintended changes


//Abstraction
//Hiding the implementation details and showing only impor/useful parts to be used
//it is used using abstract keyword , using intrfaces
//Abstract class-must have abstract keyword ,it can have abstract and non absrtact methods,it has constructor and static method also 
//it can have final methods which force not to get inherit

abstract class Animal {//it cannot be used its just a concept so we made it abstrat  its object cannot be created
    abstract void walk();//this is abstract no need to define it to define
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("eats");

//Interface -it uses pure abstraction where you have only useful information
//it does not have constructors
//there should be no non abstract function
//all feilds in interfaces are public ,final and static by default
//all methods are public and abstract by default
//a class ithat implements interface must implemnt all methods declared in interface
//interface support  functionality of multiple inheritance

//static keyword-it is special keyword which is accessibe for all for all object a property is  common so static 
//for static we do not need to make object we can diectly access using class name
//we can use static with property,method,block ,nested classes
//in static memory is allocated only once  but in obj memory is allocated again and again

//PACKAGES
// use the package keyword as the first line of your Java file,To import all classes in a package, use *.
//import to bring in classes from Javaâ€™s built-in  and user defined packages.
//In Java, packages are used to group related classes and interfaces together. They help organize code, avoid naming conflicts, and control access to classes, especially in large projects
//TYPES OF PACAKGES-builtin and user-defined
//builtin- java.util,java.lang,java.swing,java.awt
//java.lang--string,system,math 
//java.util-arraylist,hashmap,scanner 
//java.io-file,inputstream,outputstream
//java.awt and java.swing for gui component
//when you import you use "." with package name and class name eg - Bank.Account
